# OCR Project

Welcome to the OCR Project repository! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains part of the code used in the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) project being developed by our company. Due to access restrictions and internal company policies, only a limited portion of the code is available in this repository. However, here you will get an overview of the core architecture of the OCR system we are building.

## Architecture

In general, the OCR system we are developing uses machine learning and image processing techniques to recognize characters from various text sources. The system architecture consists of several key components that interact with each other to achieve optimal results.

Below is a more detailed view of the architecture:

## Key Features

- Text recognition from images (OCR).
- Preprocessing techniques to improve image quality before analysis.
- Machine learning-based system to improve text recognition accuracy.
